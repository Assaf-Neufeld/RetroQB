## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
dotnet run
```

**Workspace Tip**: Open the repo root folder (`Football2DQB`) in VS Code. This repo includes a `.vscode/settings.json` that limits Git auto-detection so the nested `RetroQB/` folder doesn't show as a separate repo.

**Requirements**: .NET 9.0 SDK

## 🎯 Tips & Strategy

- **Timing is everything** — Throw before the rush gets to you
- **Lead your receivers** — The ball is thrown where they're going, not where they are
- **Watch for contested catches** — Defenders nearby can cause drops or interceptions
- **Know when to run** — Sometimes the best play is to scramble
- **Manage the downs** — Don't force throws into coverage on early downs
